/**
 A _condition_ is the smallest sub element of the validation framework.
 It tells how a string must be structured or wat is has to contain or not.
 Validators (see US2Validator) are storing those conditions and checking
 for violations of every condition.
 Conditions are recommended working with regular expressions but can also contain
 their custom checking code for detecting violations in the string to check.
 
 By returning a localized string in method localizedViolationString the
 user can be informed in a convenient way what went wrong.
